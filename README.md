The project is about the analysis of Global Terrorism visually illustrated as a story using Tableau. The analysis provides insights into terrorism among different regions around the Globe and the timeline when terrorism increased

- The dataset consists of terrorism details that occurred between 1970 and 2019 for different regions like ASIA, AFRICA, AMERICA, EUROPE etc.
- Various charts including Global maps, column charts, bar charts, Bubble charts, Treemaps, Line graphs, and Area charts were used to visualize the effect of terrorism across each region.
- The visuals provide insights into the death rates, Number of terror attacks, the terror groups, damage types, Countries that are most affected in each region, and especially the trend of the terrorism throughout the time period.
- The insights were helpful in determining the fact that terrorism started to increase in the early 2000s and reached its peak around 2014.
